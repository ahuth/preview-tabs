* Allow image editors to be previewed. [Issue #4](https://github.com/ahuth/preview-tabs/issues/4)
* Changed internal organization of the project.

## 0.1.3

* Fixed bug where multiple open files with the same name cause strange behavior.
* Adjusted tests to clean up any DOM they create after completion.
