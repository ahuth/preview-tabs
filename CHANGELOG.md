## 0.1.3
* Use a file's path, instead of name, to identify which file/tab was clicked on. This prevents weird things
from happening when multiple files with the same name are opened, or the same file is opened in multiple panes.

## 0.1.2
* Fixed bug where multiple open files with the same name cause strange behavior.
* Adjusted tests to clean up any DOM they create after completion.

## 0.1.1
* Updated Readme grammar.

## 0.1.0
* Every feature added
* Every bug fixed
