# Preview Tabs package

Open new tabs as a 'preview', closing any previous previews. This allows you to quickly look at many files without creating
a large number of open tabs.

Doing the following makes a tab 'permanent', preventing it from being closed when new previews are opened:

* Modifying it
* Saving it
* Double clicking the tab
* Double click the file in the file tree
